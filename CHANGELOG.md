# Changelog

## [3.3.0] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed syntax error in `server.js` close() method causing improper indentation in agent session cleanup
- **Critical**: Fixed memory leaks in all three bridge files (claude-bridge.js, codex-bridge.js, agent-bridge.js) by properly tracking and clearing kill timeouts
- Fixed race condition in `session-store.js` where atomic rename could fail if directory was deleted between write and rename operations
- Fixed duplicate signal handlers in `server.js` that could cause double-shutdown attempts
- Removed call to undefined method `clearProcessedEntriesCache()` in `usage-reader.js`
- Removed unused `sessionCache` Map variable from `usage-reader.js`
- Added missing test coverage for agent alias in server alias tests
- Fixed test cleanup warnings by ensuring storage directory exists before save operations

### Changed
- Removed token usage top bar from UI - no longer displays real-time token statistics in the header
- Updated `applySettings()` to reflect removal of token stats visibility toggle
- Disabled `updateUsageDisplay()` and `startSessionTimerUpdate()` functions as UI elements no longer exist

### Notes
- All bug fixes are backward-compatible
- Usage statistics backend code still runs but is no longer displayed in the UI
- Test suite passing: 12/12 tests

## [3.2.2] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed
- Fixed loading spinner overlay remaining visible when showing folder browser
- Added proper overlay hiding before showing folder browser in all locations
- Resolves issue where users couldn't interact with folder browser due to stuck spinner

## [3.2.1] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed
- Corrected agent command from `claude-agent` to `cursor-agent` in AgentBridge
- Updated command search paths to use `~/.cursor/` instead of `~/.agent/`

## [3.2.0] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- Cursor Agent (`cursor-agent`) support as a third CLI option alongside Claude and Codex
- New CLI flag: `--agent-alias <name>` to customize the display name for Cursor Agent (default: "Cursor")
- New environment variable: `AGENT_ALIAS` for setting the agent alias
- "Start Cursor" button in assistant selection UI (main overlay and per-pane overlays)
- Full WebSocket message handling for `start_agent`, `agent_started`, and `agent_stopped` events
- Agent session management in `AgentBridge` with automatic command detection

### Changed
- Updated startup logs to display all three assistant aliases (Claude, Codex, Agent)
- Enhanced `/api/config` endpoint to include agent alias
- Extended session management to support three concurrent agent types per session

### Notes
- Backwards-compatible feature addition; existing Claude and Codex functionality unchanged
- Agent bridge searches for `cursor-agent` in standard paths (~/.cursor/local/cursor-agent, ~/.local/bin/cursor-agent, etc.)
- No special CLI flags required for agent (unlike Claude's `--dangerously-skip-permissions` or Codex's bypass flag)

## [3.1.0] - 2025-09-15

### Added
- Middle-click tab closing, inline rename styling, and automatic scroll-into-view for the active session tab to mirror VS Code ergonomics.

### Changed
- Session tabs now maintain explicit order and MRU history, improving Ctrl/Cmd+Tab navigation, drag reordering, and pane targeting parity with VS Code.
- Mobile overflow counters and menus refresh automatically on resize or drag, keeping hidden sessions reachable across devices.

### Fixed
- Tabs now disappear immediately when the backend deletes a session, preventing stale entries and redundant DELETE calls.

## [3.0.3] - 2025-09-14

### Fixed
- Single-pane and no-session states now use the full viewport width. Moved the global overlay out of the terminal container and made it `position: fixed` to prevent it from reserving layout space; ensured `.tile-grid` flexes to fill available width. This resolves the issue where, with zero tabs or a single pane, the pane did not span the full width.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.11.0] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- Up to 4 panes in Tiled View with an “Add Pane” control.
- Drag a tab onto any pane to attach that session to the pane.

### Changed
- Tiled layout now distributes widths dynamically across multiple panes; resizers adjust neighboring pane widths.

### Notes
- Client-side only; no server/CLI changes. Defaults to single‑pane; toggle and expand via the top‑bar grid/plus controls.
## [2.12.0] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- Per‑split tab bars (VS Code–style): each pane now has its own tab strip.
- Add tab per split (+ button) and attach existing sessions to a split by clicking global tabs while a pane is focused.
- Drag a global tab into a split to add/activate that session in the target pane.

### Changed
- Tiled view routing: in tiled mode, global tab clicks target the focused split; single‑pane behavior unchanged when tiles are off.

### Notes
- Client‑side feature; no API/CLI changes. State (pane tabs, active tab, widths) persists locally.

## [2.13.0] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- Close Pane control: remove a split entirely (sockets cleaned up, layout reflows); clears when only one pane remains.

### Changed
- Removed focused‑pane border highlight for a cleaner look.
- In tiled mode, the global top tab bar is hidden; manage tabs per split only.
- Pane removal re-normalizes widths and rebuilds grid for consistent resizing; state persists.

### Notes
- UI‑only changes; no server/CLI surface changes.
## [2.14.0] - 2025-09-13

### Changed
- Always-on multi‑pane mode: the tiled view is now the default and only mode.
- Global top tab bar is hidden in multi‑pane; manage tabs per split.
- Removed tile view toggle button.

### Fixed
- Pane “+” button now opens a reliable session picker menu and works in every pane.

### Notes
- UI/UX change only; no server/CLI API changes.
## [2.15.0] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- Drag a pane tab to the grid’s right edge to create a new split and move the tab (VS Code‑like “drag to split”).

### Changed
- Pane tab items are now draggable between splits; dropping on another split moves the tab there.
- Pane Add Tab button opens a session picker menu consistently across panes.

### Notes
- UI‑only; no server/CLI changes.
## [2.15.1] - 2025-09-13

### Fixed
- Start‑prompt (Claude/Codex) overlay now appears in multi‑pane mode: terminal container is kept available for overlays even when panes are active.
## [2.16.0] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- Per‑pane start prompt overlay: when a session is attached to a pane and hasn’t produced output yet, the pane shows a local dialog to pick the assistant (Claude/Codex), including dangerous variants.

### Changed
- Overlays no longer rely on the single‑pane terminal; the per‑pane overlay sits within each split.

### Notes
- UI‑only; no server/CLI changes.
## [2.17.0] - 2025-09-13

### Changed
- Closing a pane tab now fully closes the session (server DELETE), removes it from all panes, and cleans up sockets/terminals.
- Pane “+” button opens the folder picker directly to create a new session; session dropdown removed.
- Session deletion events now remove the session from all pane tab strips automatically.

### Notes
- UI/behavior change only; no server/CLI API changes.

## [2.18.0] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- Tab context menus for both global tabs and per‑pane tabs:
  - Close Others
  - Split Right
  - Move to Split (choose destination split)
- Drag‑to‑split in all directions (left/right/top/bottom) with visual drop hints.
- Ctrl/Cmd‑drag to copy a tab to another split; default drag moves the tab.

### Changed
- Vertical splits supported (up to 2 rows) with a horizontal resizer; sizes persist.
- Edge‑of‑grid drops create splits on that edge; drag cursor reflects copy vs move.
- Layout persistence now includes rows, cols, and heights in `cc-web-tiles`.

### Notes
- UI‑only features; no server/CLI API changes.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-09-13

### Removed
- Custom prompts dropdown UI ("/" button, commands list, and "Custom…" modal).
- Server endpoints `GET /api/commands/list` and `GET /api/commands/content`.

### Breaking Changes
- The commands dropdown system and its APIs are no longer available. Any external automation calling `/api/commands/*` must be migrated to send content directly to the active session via WebSocket input.

### Migration Notes
- To send predefined prompts, store them in your own UI or scripts and paste/send directly to the terminal. The app will forward input to the active session as before.

## [3.0.1] - 2025-09-13

### Fixed
- Remove an empty left column gap in tiled mode by hiding the single-pane container when tiles are enabled.
- Restore per-pane assistant chooser overlay by not treating 'idle' sessions as already running.

## [3.0.2] - 2025-09-13

### Fixed
- Stabilize tiled splitting: correct index math and use insertion helpers for columns/rows.
- Reattach active sessions to terminals after grid rebuilds so sessions no longer appear to vanish.
- Honor copy vs move when dragging tabs between splits and avoid removing from the wrong source pane.
- Improve edge-of-grid splits to consistently place the tab into the intended new split.
## [3.0.4] - 2025-09-14

### Fixed
- Restore VS Code-style tab workflow: global tabs are visible in both single and tiled modes; selecting a tab targets the active pane.
- Make tiled panes optional again (no auto-enable on load); preserve pane layout and assignments across refresh via localStorage.
- Pane “+” opens a reliable session picker (Shift+click opens folder browser to create a new one).
- When attaching an existing session to a split, replay recent output buffer so tabs don’t look like “new” empty sessions.
- Remove CSS that hid tabs in tiled mode; panes fill width without interfering with the tab bar.
