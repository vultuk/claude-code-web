## [2.10.0] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- Tiled View (MVP): view two sessions side‑by‑side with independent terminals and sockets.
- Resizable splitter between panes with persistent split position.
- Per‑pane session picker and close controls; layout and assignments persist in localStorage.

### Changed
- Settings font size now applies to all visible panes in tiled view.

### Notes
- Client‑side only; no server/CLI changes required. Default remains single‑pane; toggle via new tile button in the top bar.

## [2.9.0] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- Theme toggle in Settings with persistence (Dark/Light).
- Early theme application to avoid flash of incorrect theme on load.

### Changed
- Default theme set to Dark; Light can be selected in Settings.

### Notes

## [2.8.0] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- Inline SVG icon system across the UI to replace emojis for a premium, minimalist look.
- New icon helper at `src/public/icons.js` for consistent, dependency‑free icons.
- Subtle status indicators using CSS dots (active/idle/error) in place of emoji glyphs.

### Changed
- Refined visual design: cohesive light palette by default, improved spacing and rhythm, and cleaner typography (Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for terminal/stats).
- Usage rate display now uses an icon + text rather than emoji; improved readability on mobile/desktop.
- Plan modal header and action buttons now include icons; tooltips and labels simplified.
- Notifications and headings no longer use emojis; copy updated for a professional tone.
- Auth prompt UI aligned with the new palette and iconography.

### Fixed
- Prevented potential null‑element errors in plan mode indicator updates.

### Notes

### Added
- Up to 4 panes in Tiled View with an “Add Pane” control.
- Drag a tab onto any pane to attach that session to the pane.

### Changed
- Tiled layout now distributes widths dynamically across multiple panes; resizers adjust neighboring pane widths.

## [2.12.0] - 2025-09-13

- Add tab per split (+ button) and attach existing sessions to a split by clicking global tabs while a pane is focused.
- Drag a global tab into a split to add/activate that session in the target pane.

### Changed
- Tiled view routing: in tiled mode, global tab clicks target the focused split; single‑pane behavior unchanged when tiles are off.

### Notes
- Client‑side feature; no API/CLI changes. State (pane tabs, active tab, widths) persists locally.

## [2.13.0] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- Close Pane control: remove a split entirely (sockets cleaned up, layout reflows); clears when only one pane remains.

### Changed
- Removed focused‑pane border highlight for a cleaner look.
- In tiled mode, the global top tab bar is hidden; manage tabs per split only.
- Pane removal re-normalizes widths and rebuilds grid for consistent resizing; state persists.

### Notes
