# Scroll Position Restoration Test Summary

## Issue Fixed
**Bug: Session reconnection loses scroll position and context** (#12)

## Problem
- When reconnecting to sessions after disconnect/refresh, terminal always scrolled to bottom
- Output buffer was limited to 200 lines, causing context loss
- No mechanism to preserve user's scroll position
- Sometimes displayed garbled ANSI sequences

## Solution Implemented

### Client-Side Changes (src/public/app.js)
1. **Added scroll position tracking properties**:
   - `scrollPosition`: Stores captured position
   - `pendingScrollRestore`: Tracks restoration state

2. **Created scroll position management methods**:
   - `captureScrollPosition()`: Captures position as distance from bottom
   - `restoreScrollPosition()`: Restores position after buffer replay

3. **Enhanced session lifecycle handlers**:
   - Modified `leaveSession()` to capture scroll position
   - Modified `disconnect()` to capture position on disconnection  
   - Added `beforeunload` handler to capture position on page refresh
   - Enhanced `session_joined` handler to restore position

4. **Added new WebSocket message type**: `update_scroll_position`

### Server-Side Changes (src/server.js)
1. **Extended session data structure**:
   - Added `scrollPosition` property to session objects

2. **Enhanced session management**:
   - Modified `joinClaudeSession()` to send stored scroll position
   - Added handlers for `leave_session` with scroll position data
   - Added `update_scroll_position` message handler

3. **Improved buffer management**:
   - Increased max buffer size: 1000 → 2000 lines
   - Increased reconnection buffer: 200 → 500 lines

## Technical Implementation

### Scroll Position Calculation
```javascript
// Captures scroll position as distance from bottom for robust restoration
const distanceFromBottom = length - (viewportY + this.terminal.rows);
```

### Restoration Logic
```javascript
// Restores to exact position or falls back to appropriate default
if (position.distanceFromBottom > 0) {
    const targetLine = Math.max(0, currentLength - position.distanceFromBottom - this.terminal.rows);
    this.terminal.scrollToLine(targetLine);
} else {
    this.terminal.scrollToBottom(); // Was at bottom
}
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ All scroll position methods implemented correctly
- ✅ Position captured on session leave/disconnect
- ✅ Position stored in server-side session state  
- ✅ Position restored after buffer replay
- ✅ Buffer sizes increased for better context preservation
- ✅ Session reconnection preserves user context

## Benefits
- Users maintain their place when reconnecting to sessions
- Larger output buffer preserves more context (2.5x increase)
- Better handling of network disconnections and page refreshes
- Improved user experience for long-running sessions
- Backward compatible - no breaking changes

## Demo
Session restoration now maintains scroll position and preserves more context, eliminating the frustrating behavior of always jumping to the bottom on reconnection.
